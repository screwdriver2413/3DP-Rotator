# 3DP-Rotator
3d Printed Antenna Rotator Project - To be used with various antennas to communicate with satellite and other radio sources in conjunction with gpredict for satellite tracking.


***Current Status***
(1) Structure \ Body design underway. Drafts being printed as we speak to confirm measurements. Will be modeled for 360 azimuth movement with elevation. Looking to make a quality option for use with gpredict.

(2) ESP32 Code - Various programming tests completed with assistance from Grok. Servo's are all moving and performing well. Waiting on the structure to be complete for final testing.

***Materials Used***
MG996R Servo Motors (2) - https://amzn.to/3IkjZsl (not 360* continuous motion modified versions, we need the position tracking)
Adafruit Feedback 360 Servo (1) (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3614) - 360 rotation with feedback sensor \ wire
ESP32-WROOM-32 - https://amzn.to/4pszZcL
Breadboard and various wires for testing and connectivity - https://amzn.to/4majBe5

      -I am modeling an adapter for my rotator to move the dish and antenna from this project specifically as many have had great success here. All credit for that to t0nito. As a handheld or tripod mount project, it's rock solid.
