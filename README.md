***3DP-Rotator***<br />
3d Printed Antenna Rotator Project - To be used with various antennas to communicate with satellite and other radio sources in conjunction with gpredict for satellite tracking.<br />

Follow along as I am printing parts @ https://www.twitch.tv/radiomakerlive<br />


***Current Status***<br />
(1) Structure \ Body design underway. Drafts being printed as we speak to confirm measurements. Will be modeled for 360 azimuth movement with elevation. Looking to make a quality option for use with gpredict.

(2) ESP32 Code - Various programming tests completed with assistance from Grok. Worm Gear Motors are all moving and performing well. Waiting on the structure to be complete for final testing.<br /><br />
